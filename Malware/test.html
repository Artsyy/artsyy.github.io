<h1> Ransomware</h1>
<h2> What is Ransomware </h2>
<p> Ransomware is malware that locks or encrypts files on a computer or mobile device, so the hacker can demand money for the return of those files to their owner.  This type of attack can target anyone or anything: businesses, individuals, government agencies, academic institutions, and law enforcement agencies.  The malware can infect a computer through emails and websites, or hackers can infect your computer directly if they have installed a backdoor during previous access to a computer. </p>
<p> The business of ransomware is fairly lucrative, with Symantec estimating that, conservatively, around $5 million is extorted from victims (individuals) of these attacks every year.  Ransomware first showed up in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe through 2005-2009, but until recently with the creation of bitcoin, it lacked a reliable way to collect money from victims. </p>
<p> Ransomware mostly preys off of people’s inexperience with computers and the internet, tricking people with official looking images and messages in order to extort money from them.</p>

<h2> How Did Ransomware Evolve? </h2>
<p> Ransomware has evolved through many different forms since its inception in 1989 when it was delivered through floppy disc.  The methods of delivery and encryption have evolved to be harder and harder to stop through the years.  With earlier methods being able to be avoided by simply rebooting the computer or finding the files after they have been moved, now they actually encrypt and lock machines.  Some people even sell ransomware software to others on the dark web, taking a percentage cut from the revenue their customers take in. </p>
<h2> What are the different types of Malware? </h2>
<ul>
<li> Crypto-malware is the most common type of malware, they encrypt the files on a computer blocking the owner from accessing them until the ransom is paid. </li>
<li> Lockers infect the OS of your computer and completely lock you out making it impossible to access any apps or files.</li>
<li> Scareware is fake software that claims to have found a virus in your computer and demands money to remove it.  Sometimes it locks your files and other times it floods your screen with popups and adds until you pay to remove them. </li>
<li> Doxware threatens to publish your personal information online if you don’t pay.</li>
<li> RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) is handled anonymously by a hacker who manages the full process- distribution, payment, and decryption- for a cut of the ransom. </li>
</ul>
